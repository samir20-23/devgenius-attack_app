## About the Project
**DevGenius** is a batch-based brute-force tool for testing Wi-Fi security. This tool uses a wordlist-based approach to attempt password cracking for Wi-Fi networks.

---

## Features
- Wordlist-based brute-force attack
- Displays password attempt speed (passwords per minute)
- User-friendly interface with color-coded outputs
- Resets network profiles to ensure accurate testing

---

## How to Use the App
### Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- Command Prompt (CMD)
- Administrative privileges

### Steps to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samir20-23/devgenius-attack_app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd devgenius-attack_app
   ```
3. Prepare a wordlist file (`.txt`) in (`devgenius-attack_app\Source_Code\passwords\`)containing potential Wi-Fi passwords.
4. Open the `DevGenius.bat` file in an administrator Command Prompt.
5. Follow the prompts to:
   - Select your Wi-Fi interface
   - Choose a target Wi-Fi network
   - Provide the path to your wordlist file
6. Monitor the tool as it attempts to connect to the target network using the provided wordlist.

## How the App Was Created
- **Developer**: Samir
- **Purpose**: To create an efficient tool for testing the security of Wi-Fi networks.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - Batch scripting
  - Windows CMD commands (`netsh wlan`, etc.)
- **Development Process**:
  - Wrote a batch script to automate Wi-Fi attacks
  - Designed a user-friendly interface with color-coded outputs
  - Implemented a mechanism to calculate and display speed (passwords per minute)
  - Enhanced the script for error handling and stability
  - Tested extensively on multiple networks and wordlists

---

## Renaming the App
The app has been renamed to **DevGenius** to reflect its advanced capabilities and focus on development.

---

## Ethical Note
This tool is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool to access Wi-Fi networks is illegal. Use it only to test the security of networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
